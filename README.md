dotfiles
========

Useful default dotfiles for Mac OSX


Initializing:

I'm using zsh and I'm initializing this via the ```~/.zshrc``` by adding the following line:

```
# Initialize dotfiles
source /Users/godspeed/.dotfilesinit
```

You can also initialize the cool z script (to navigate to most recent folders)

```
# init z   https://github.com/rupa/z
. ~/dotfiles/z/z.sh
```
